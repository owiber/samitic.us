<p>In what seems to have been a last-ditch effort, we&#8217;ve recently discovered the following on <a href="http://www.kxan.com/dpp/news/crime/ut-student-wakes%2C-finds-intruder-in-bed">KXAN</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><em><strong>UT student wakes, finds intruder in bed</strong></p>
<p>A University of Texas students says she woke up to find an intruder in her bed early Sunday morning at the Moore-Hill dormitory.</p>
<p>University of Texas Police are now looking for an Asian male with short black hair who was wearing a white t-shirt and black basketball shorts at the time of the incident.</p>
<p>According to UTPD, the girl woke up around 3 a.m. on Sunday morning to find the man in her room. He attempted to pull the bed covers over her and lay on top her, but she resisted and he left the room when the girl screamed for help.</p>
<p></em></p></blockquote>
<p>Earlier that day, the following was on Sam&#8217;s Facebook:</p>
<p><a href="http://samitic.us/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/sam-risk-table.png"><img src="http://samitic.us/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/sam-risk-table.png" alt="" title="sam-risk-table" width="326" height="59" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-111" /></a></p>
<p>We&#8217;ll let you put together the pieces to this &#8220;puzzle.&#8221;</p>
<p>That said, happy birthday, Sam!  Hope your mom can find you a girl that doesn&#8217;t mind making conjugal visits to your jail cell.</p>

Obviously the only person who has motive is Sam Ni. Shame on you, Sam! Find another girl (or <a href="http://samitic.us/2010/10/the-oches/">man?</a>) to pursue with your insane lust!</p>
<p>Luckily, they managed to salvage this unfortunate situation by having the invites resent to an undisclosed location so Sam couldn&#8217;t steal them once again.</p>
<p>In other news, Sam Ni stars in the latest Meatcation 2 trailer:</p>

<p>Coming soon are videos from a party Sam attended and some reports of harassment committed by Sam.</p>

<p>After living with Sam for a few years, I&#8217;ve learned that he has a strong fondness for pigs.  When we were recently playing DotA, I was a pig-like hero and was facing Sam.  Whenever I would run around, I&#8217;d say &#8220;oink, oink, Sam, oink, oink!&#8221;  This apparently made Sam too aroused to play well and so he got very upset and told me to shut up.</p>
<p>This photo came from our BV trip to Seaworld&#8230; apparently someone shares the same love of piggies as Sam.</p>
